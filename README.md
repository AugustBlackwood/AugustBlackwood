- 👋 Hi, I’m @AugustBlackwood and my pronouns are he/him/his and occasionally they/them/their(s).
- 👀 I’m interested in everything computers. How to build them, how to program them, how to create websites, etc... I also love art, the occult, animals, and books, just to name a few other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding/web languages. I'm currently refreshing my memory at W3Schools, but am looking into other coding resources such as FreeCodeCamp and Code Academy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I don't have anything in mind as far as projects go... Well... I actually do, but I don't know enough to start the project yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
